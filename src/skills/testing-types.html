    <p>
      As a QA professional, I apply various types of testing depending on the project requirements. Each testing type plays a vital role in identifying different types of issues at various stages of the software development life cycle.
    </p>

    <h2>Functional Testing</h2>
    <p>
      Verifies that the software works as expected based on the functional requirements. It includes testing features, forms, and workflows.
    </p>

    <h2>Regression Testing</h2>
    <p>
      Ensures that new code changes do not negatively affect existing functionality. I regularly perform this before each release.
    </p>

    <h2>Smoke Testing</h2>
    <p>
      A quick check to confirm that the basic functionalities are working and the build is stable enough for further testing.
    </p>

    <h2>UI Testing</h2>
    <p>
      Checks the visual elements of the application such as alignment, responsiveness, colors, and consistency across devices.
    </p>

    <h2>Exploratory Testing</h2>
    <p>
      Done without formal test cases — based on intuition, experience, and user behavior to uncover edge-case bugs.
    </p>

    <h2>Usability Testing</h2>
    <p>
      Evaluates the user-friendliness of the interface and identifies areas where the user experience can be improved.
    </p>

    <h2>Compatibility Testing</h2>
    <p>
      Verifies application behavior across multiple browsers, screen sizes, and operating systems.
    </p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      Choosing the right type of testing at the right time helps ensure quality, usability, and performance. I adapt my approach based on the project needs and priorities.
