    <p>
      To maintain structured and traceable testing, I use professional test management tools that help plan, document, and track the testing process. These tools improve team collaboration and help align testing with development cycles.
    </p>

    <h2>Jira</h2>
    <p>
      I use <strong>Jira</strong> to manage test tasks, link bugs with stories, and follow Agile workflows. It helps the team stay on track and ensures all test-related activities are visible and traceable.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Create and assign test-related tasks</li>
      <li>Log and track bugs efficiently</li>
      <li>Collaborate with developers and product managers</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Testworthy</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Testworthy</strong> allows me to create test cases, execute them, and track test progress with ease. It’s especially useful for managing structured test cycles.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Write and organize manual test cases</li>
      <li>Link bugs with specific test steps</li>
      <li>View execution status and coverage</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Why These Tools Matter</h2>
    <p>
      These tools ensure traceability, accountability, and better team collaboration. They also make reporting and test cycle management much more efficient.
    </p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      With tools like Jira and Testworthy, I maintain a high standard of QA documentation and ensure all test activities are tracked and managed effectively.
