      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        Manual testing is the process of manually checking software applications
        to ensure they behave as expected. As a QA specialist, I have strong
        experience in functional, UI, usability, and exploratory testing across
        both web and mobile platforms.
      </p>

      <h2>What I Do in Manual Testing</h2>
      <ul>
        <li
          >Test each feature thoroughly based on requirements and user
          perspective</li
        >
        <li>Create and execute detailed test cases</li>
        <li>Verify bug fixes and perform regression testing</li>
        <li>Report issues with proper reproduction steps and screenshots</li>
        <li>Validate UI behavior, responsiveness, and edge case handling</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Tools I Use</h2>
      <p>
        While manual testing focuses on human interaction, I use the following
        tools to organize and report:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li
          ><strong>Jira</strong> – For managing test tasks, reporting bugs, and
          sprint planning</li
        >
        <li
          ><strong>Testworthy</strong> – For writing and tracking test cases
          efficiently</li
        >
        <li
          ><strong>Google Sheets/Excel</strong> – For quick, shareable test
          plans and checklists</li
        >
      </ul>

      />

      <h2>Types of Manual Testing I Perform</h2>
      <ul>
        <li
          ><strong>Functional Testing:</strong> Ensure features meet expected
          behavior</li
        >
        <li
          ><strong>Regression Testing:</strong> Re-test existing features after
          new changes</li
        >
        <li
          ><strong>Smoke & Sanity Testing:</strong> Basic checks before full
          testing begins</li
        >
        <li
          ><strong>Exploratory Testing:</strong> Based on instinct and user
          experience</li
        >
        <li
          ><strong>UI Testing:</strong> Visual consistency, layout,
          responsiveness checks</li
        >
      </ul>

      <h2>My Experience</h2>
      <p>
        I’ve worked on multiple projects where manual testing played a critical
        role. From testing health-related mobile apps to cross-browser
        validation of marketing websites, I ensured quality at every level. My
        work helped teams identify edge case bugs, fix inconsistencies, and
        release stable builds with confidence.
      </p>

      <p>Here are a few of the projects I contributed manual testing to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li
          ><strong>Kido Protect App:</strong> Parent/child access control, PIN
          setup, and QR linking</li
        >
        <li
          ><strong>Youth Health Hub:</strong> Symptom tracking and checkup
          result accuracy</li
        >
        <li
          ><strong>Nextiva Website:</strong> UI consistency, link checks,
          responsive design testing</li
        >
      </ul>

      <h2>Why Manual Testing Still Matters</h2>
      <p>
        While automation is growing fast, manual testing is still essential —
        especially for usability, design flaws, and human-centric flows. It
        allows testers to think like real users and catch issues automation
        might miss.

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        With my manual testing skills, I ensure products deliver smooth,
        bug-free, and user-friendly experiences. I combine attention to detail
        with real-world testing approaches to deliver high-quality results.
